# Crypto Products

Crypto products can be highly risky, and their regulatory treatment is unsettled in many jurisdictions. There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from transactions in `$VAYU`. Any value ascribed to `$VAYU` may change quickly and may be lost in its entirety. Further, the technologies comprising the Vayu.network Platform, including the `$VAYU` token, are experimental in nature. There is no guarantee that the network will operate as planned. Holding, buying, or selling `$VAYU` may not be permitted where you live, and it is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws. Vayu.network `$VAYU` tokens are not intended to be available to residents of the United States or certain other restricted territories. More details can be found on our website.

As described further below, this document contains forward-looking estimates and statements regarding the intended actions and objectives of the Vayu.network team, based largely on current expectations and projections about future events for which the outcome is uncertain. It is, therefore, subject to a number of known and unknown risks that could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from what is expressed or implied herein. Readers are cautioned not to rely on these future-looking estimates and statements. The content of this document speaks only as of the date thereof.

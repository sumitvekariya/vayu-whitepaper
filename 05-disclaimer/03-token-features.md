# Token Features

The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the Vayu.network (`$VAYU`) is a transferable representation of the functions specified in the protocol of the Vayu.network. `$VAYU` is designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem and is intended to be used solely as the primary utility and future governance token on the platform.

The goal of introducing `$VAYU` is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the Vayu.network ecosystem (e.g., for the purchase of data). It is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the Vayu.network.

`$VAYU` may only be utilized on the Vayu.network, and ownership of `$VAYU` carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use `$VAYU` as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the Vayu.network.

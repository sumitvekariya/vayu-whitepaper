# Our Mission

Vayu.network's mission is to build the world's largest and most comprehensive hub for user-generated indoor air quality data. By leveraging our innovative Flux device, we are creating a decentralized network that provides real-time, hyper-local insights into the air we breathe indoors.

Just as weather data guides our daily plans, Vayu.network's data will empower millions to make smarter, healthier decisions about the environments where they live, work, and learn, ultimately enhancing their well-being and quality of life.

# The Problem

**The Invisible Threat of Indoor Air Pollution**

While we are increasingly aware of outdoor air pollution, the air inside our homes, offices, and schools often goes unmonitored and can be significantly more polluted. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that Americans spend approximately 90% of their time indoors, where concentrations of some pollutants can be 2 to 5 times higher than typical outdoor levels.

## The Unseen Health Crisis

This isn't just a matter of comfort; it's a critical public health issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that household air pollution was responsible for 3.2 million deaths in 2020. Invisible pollutants like Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) silently impact our health and cognitive function. Long-term exposure is linked to a range of serious health problems, including:

*   **Respiratory Illnesses:** From allergies and asthma to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   **Cardiovascular Disease:** Including stroke and ischaemic heart disease.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Function & Productivity:** High CO2 levels, common in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, can lead to headaches, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.
*   **Cancer:** Long-term exposure to certain indoor pollutants is a known risk factor for lung cancer.

The people most vulnerable—the very young, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions—tend to spend the most time indoors, magnifying their exposure and risk.

## The Data and Device Dilemma

Despite the clear risks, our approach to managing air quality has major flaws:

1.  **Lack of Personalized Data:** Current air quality monitoring is broad and generalized. You might know the air quality index for your city, but you have no insight into the air quality in your child's bedroom, your office, or your daily commute. This lack of hyper-local data prevents us from making informed decisions to protect our health.

2.  **Inconvenient and Cumbersome Technology:** For those who are proactive about monitoring their environment, the solution has been to carry multiple, separate devices—a power bank to keep their phone charged and a bulky air quality monitor. This is inefficient, inconvenient, and not a viable solution for the average person.

There is a clear and urgent need for a solution that provides personalized, real-time indoor air quality data in a seamless and user-friendly way.

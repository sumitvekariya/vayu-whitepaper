## Vayu.network's Commitment to Data Privacy

At Vayu.network, privacy is not an afterthought; it is a foundational principle of our entire system. We are deeply committed to safeguarding our users' data and providing full transparency and control. Here is how we ensure your privacy is always protected:

## The Vayu.network Dataset: Non-Personal by Nature

Vayu.network is designed to measure and collect specific environmental data points: Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), equivalent CO2 (eCO2), and the corresponding anonymized location data.

Our technology is built to quantify the invisible environment around you. We do not and cannot collect any personal data, such as audio, images, or personal files from your phone or any other device. You can trust Vayu.network to deliver valuable insights into environmental air quality without compromising your personal privacy.

## Privacy by Design

Vayu.network adheres to "privacy by design" principles, meaning data protection is embedded into our technology from the very beginning. This approach ensures compliance with the most stringent data privacy laws and regulations, including GDPR.

## Privacy in the Sign-up & Onboarding Procedure

1.  **Anonymous Usernames:** We encourage the use of non-identifiable usernames or emails to protect your identity. Even if you use a personal email, Vayu.network hashes this information and stores it separately from the measurement datasets. Your email is never shared.
2.  **No Unnecessary Personal Information:** Vayu.network does not require personal information like your legal name, phone number, or credit card details. We only require a login method (like email) for account management and security.
3.  **Specific, Granular Consent:** We are fully transparent about the consent we ask for. During onboarding, we request your consent to receive and process the anonymized sensor data from your Flux device. This consent can be revoked at any time in the app's settings.
4.  **Age Verification:** We require users to be over the legal age of consent for data use in their jurisdiction (e.g., 18 in many regions).

## Privacy In-App Use

1.  **Anonymized Data:** Air quality data collected by Vayu.network is dissociated from your user account information in our analytical databases. We sell aggregated trends, not your individual journey.
2.  **Data Deletion:** You can request the deletion of your account and associated data at any time.
3.  **Data Access:** You can view the data your device has contributed at any time within the app.
4.  **Usage Without Consent:** If you revoke consent for data collection, your device will no longer contribute to the network, but you can still use the app to view the Vayu Explorer and manage your wallet.

## Privacy in Data Storage and Commercialization

1.  **Data Minimization:** We only collect and store the data necessary for the network's function.
2.  **Anonymized Data Sales:** We sell trends and statistical analyses, not data tied to individual users. We provide insights into aggregated indoor air quality trends within cities, building types, and other large-scale categories.
3.  **Consent on the Blockchain:** User consent is managed through the blockchain, creating an immutable and auditable record. This makes our dataset highly valuable in a market wary of improperly managed data.

## Compliance with GDPR and US Privacy Laws

Vayu.network's practices align with GDPR and US privacy laws, ensuring transparency and compliance.

1.  **Legal Basis:** We process data on a contract performance basis (Art. 6 1b, GDPR) and with explicit, informed user consent (Art. 6 1a, GDPR).
2.  **Aggregated Data:** Sharing aggregated data is permissible as it does not identify individuals.
3.  **Pseudonymized Data:** Any sharing of pseudonymized data is conducted with sufficient consent, adhering to all relevant regulations.

By embedding these principles into our architecture, Vayu.network ensures that user data is handled securely and ethically, fostering a community built on trust and transparency.

# Fraud Detection Consequences

Vayu.network maintains a zero-tolerance policy for fraudulent activity. Our goal is to protect the integrity of the network and ensure that honest contributors are rewarded fairly.

If a user or device is identified by our anomaly detection engine as engaging in fraudulent behavior, the following actions will be taken:

*   The associated user account will be permanently banned.
*   The offending Flux device may be blacklisted from contributing to the network.
*   All earned `$VAYU` tokens associated with the fraudulent activity will be forfeited.
*   The user will be removed from all community leaderboards and recognition programs.
*   Any associated user referrals will be voided.

We reserve the right to refine and expand these measures as needed to protect the health of the Vayu.network ecosystem.

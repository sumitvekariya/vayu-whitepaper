# Database Backups and Encryption

To ensure the highest levels of data security, availability, and integrity, Vayu.network employs industry-best practices for our database management.

We utilize a managed SQL cloud database service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS. This approach provides several critical advantages:

*   **Automated Backups:** The service automatically creates regular backups of our entire database, ensuring that we can quickly recover from any unforeseen event with minimal data loss.
*   **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** All data within our database is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms. Likewise, all data transmitted to and from the database is encrypted in transit, protecting it from interception.
*   **High Availability and Reliability:** Managed services provide robust, automated failover support and are architected for high availability, which minimizes downtime and ensures the Vayu Explorer and our backend services remain responsive.
*   **Simplified Maintenance and Scaling:** The service handles routine maintenance, patching, and scaling, allowing our development team to focus on building features for the Vayu.network community.

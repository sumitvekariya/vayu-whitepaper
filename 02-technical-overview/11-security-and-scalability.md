# Security and Scalability

Vayu.network is built on a highly secure and scalable infrastructure, primarily using Amazon Web Services (AWS), to support our global backend operations. The following key features ensure robust performance, data protection, and the ability to grow with our community.

*   **Load Balancing:** We use the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to efficiently distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances. This ensures high availability and redundancy, providing a consistent and responsive experience even during peak traffic.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Our infrastructure employs an auto-scaling strategy that automatically provisions additional computing resources based on real-time demand. As more users and devices join the network, the infrastructure scales up seamlessly to maintain performance. During quieter periods, it scales down to optimize costs.
*   **Managed Cloud Database:** As detailed previously, using AWS RDS for our database ensures reliable data handling, automated backups, and effortless scaling to meet query load, minimizing downtime and maintaining data integrity.
*   **Secure Network Architecture:** Our network is designed with security as a priority. A Bastion Host manages all administrative access to internal resources, restricting any direct access to our core backend services from the public internet. This significantly reduces the attack surface and risk of unauthorized intrusion.
*   **Hardware Security:** The Flux device firmware is designed with security in mind. It will feature secure bootloaders to prevent unauthorized firmware from being loaded and encrypted communication channels to protect data in transit to the mobile app. Future updates will include hardware attestation to prevent device spoofing.
*   **Observability and Alerting:** We use advanced monitoring and automated alerting systems (like AWS CloudWatch) to provide real-time visibility into our entire infrastructure. This enables our team to respond proactively to any anomalies and maintain optimal performance.
*   **Rigorous Testing & CI/CD:** All backend code is subject to extensive unit and integration testing, with a target of >80% code coverage. We utilize robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines with integrated secret managers to ensure secure and reliable deployment of new features and updates.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** We use tools like Terraform to manage our cloud infrastructure as code. This allows for better versioning, easy replication of environments for testing, and a more secure and consistent infrastructure management process.

These components ensure that the Vayu.network backend can handle increasing global demand while safeguarding user data and maintaining operational stability.

# Introducing a Power User: Maria, the Facility Manager

<!-- TODO: rewrite this section with specific details -->
To better illustrate the practical, real-world value of Vayu.network, let's meet Maria.

Maria is the facility manager for a chain of modern, upscale co-working spaces. Her job is to ensure that the buildings are not only comfortable and functional but also healthy and safe for the hundreds of members who work there every day.

## The Challenge

Recently, tenants have become more aware of and concerned about indoor air quality. Maria has received questions about ventilation, air filtration, and CO2 levels. She knows that ensuring high air quality can be a major selling point for attracting and retaining tenants, but she has no way to actually measure it, prove it, or identify problem areas across her multiple locations. Her current HVAC systems run on a fixed schedule, wasting energy by ventilating empty rooms.

## The Vayu.network Solution

Maria's company purchases a fleet of Flux devices and places them throughout their co-working locationsâ€”in open-plan work areas, conference rooms, and private offices.

1.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Through the Vayu Explorer dashboard, Maria can now see a real-time map of the air quality across all her buildings. She immediately identifies a large conference room where CO2 levels consistently spike during long meetings, indicating poor ventilation. She schedules an HVAC maintenance check and is able to resolve the issue.
2.  **Smart Automation:** By integrating the Vayu API with their building management system, the HVAC now runs based on real-time data. When CO2 levels in a room rise, ventilation automatically increases. When a room is empty, the system scales back, saving significant energy costs.
3.  **Marketing & Tenant Trust:** Maria's company now has verifiable, transparent data proving their commitment to a healthy work environment. They display a "Vayu Certified - Healthy Air" badge on their marketing materials and can even show prospective tenants the live air quality data, building immense trust and creating a powerful competitive advantage.
4.  **Earning Rewards:** As a bonus, the Flux devices owned by Maria's company are passively earning `$VAYU` tokens, creating a new revenue stream that offsets the initial hardware investment.

For Maria, Vayu.network is not just a data source; it's a tool that helps her save money, attract more customers, and create a healthier, more productive environment for her community.

The vision for Vayu.network is led by a team of founders with deep and complementary expertise in hardware engineering, software development, and environmental entrepreneurship.

**Dr. Anya Sharma**
*Co-Founder & CEO*

Anya is a mission-driven entrepreneur with a passion for leveraging technology to solve critical environmental challenges. Before co-founding Vayu.network, she led product development at a leading smart-home IoT company, where she was responsible for launching a successful line of connected environmental sensors. Her experience sits at the perfect intersection of consumer hardware, data monetization, and a genuine desire to create healthier living spaces.

Anya holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, where her research focused on the impact of indoor airborne pollutants on cognitive function. This deep scientific understanding is the bedrock of Vayu's mission. She is an avid rock climber and believes that the most challenging problems are the most rewarding to solve.

**Ben Carter**
*Co-Founder & CTO*

Ben is a seasoned software architect and full-stack developer with over 15 years of experience building highly scalable data platforms. His most recent role was as the lead architect for a major cloud provider's IoT division, where he designed the infrastructure responsible for ingesting and processing data from millions of devices globally.

His expertise in distributed systems, data security, and Web3 technologies is critical to building the robust and decentralized backend of the Vayu.network. Ben has been an active contributor to open-source blockchain projects since 2018 and is a firm believer in the power of DePIN to create more transparent and equitable systems. In his spare time, Ben is a dedicated marathon runner.

**Carlos Reyes**
*Co-Founder & COO*

Carlos is an expert in hardware operations and global supply chain management. He has spent his career in the trenches of consumer electronics manufacturing, overseeing the entire product lifecycle from initial design for manufacturing (DFM) to mass production and global logistics. Prior to Vayu, he managed the supply chain for a popular consumer drone company, successfully navigating the complexities of component sourcing, factory management, and quality control.

His hands-on experience is invaluable in bringing the Flux device from a concept to a high-quality physical product in the hands of our community. Carlos is a lifelong tinkerer, always taking apart electronics to understand how they work, and is passionate about creating products that are both beautiful and built to last.

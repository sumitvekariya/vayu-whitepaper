# Extended Core Contributors

Beyond the founders and scientific advisors, the Vayu.network is powered by a talented and distributed team of engineers, product designers, community managers, and marketing specialists.

While our founders set the vision, it is this extended team that handles the day-to-day executionâ€”from writing the code for our mobile app and managing our cloud infrastructure, to designing the user experience and engaging with our vibrant community on social media.

You can learn more about the individuals building Vayu.network on our official LinkedIn page. While many team members proudly list Vayu.network in their profiles, please note that we do not control who adds the company to their profile, so the listed number of employees may not always be a precise reflection of our current team size.

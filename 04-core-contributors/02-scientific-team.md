# Scientific Team

<!-- TODO: rewrite this section with specific details -->
The Vayu.network is supported by a scientific advisory board composed of leading academics with deep expertise in air quality, sensor technology, and data science. Their guidance ensures that our data collection methodologies and analytical models are grounded in the latest scientific research.

**Dr. Lena Petrova (Ph.D.)**

Dr. Petrova is a renowned expert in atmospheric chemistry and a tenured professor at a leading technical university. Her research focuses on the composition and health impacts of indoor air pollutants, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM2.5). She is the author of over 80 peer-reviewed publications and a co-author of the seminal textbook, "The Chemistry of Indoor Environments."

Dr. Petrova advises the Vayu.network on sensor selection, data interpretation, and the development of our air quality indexing model. Her insights are crucial for ensuring that the data we provide is not only accurate but also meaningful and actionable for our users and data consumers. She has previously served on advisory panels for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning indoor air quality standards.

**Professor David Chen (Ph.D.)**

Professor Chen is an Associate Professor of Computer Science specializing in time-series data analysis and machine learning for sensor networks. His lab develops novel algorithms for anomaly detection, data imputation, and predictive modeling using large-scale IoT datasets.

He advises the Vayu.network on the architecture of our data validation pipeline and the development of our fraud detection engine. His work is vital for maintaining the integrity and quality of the Vayu dataset, ensuring that it is a reliable and trustworthy source of information. Professor Chen's work on sensor data fusion has been published in top-tier computer science conferences, and he holds several patents related to distributed sensor analytics.

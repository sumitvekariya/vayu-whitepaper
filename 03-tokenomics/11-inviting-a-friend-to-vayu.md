# Inviting a Friend to Vayu.network

To accelerate the growth of our data network, Vayu.network includes a powerful, built-in referral program.

**Users who invite a friend to the network will receive a continuous bonus on the Vayu Points their friend earns from data contributions.**

This means that for as long as your referred friend is contributing data with their Flux device, you will receive a percentage of the Vayu Points they generate. This bonus does not reduce your friend's earnings; it is an extra reward generated by the network to thank you for helping it grow.

This system is designed to create a strong viral coefficient, where our most passionate community members are directly rewarded for evangelizing the project and bringing new, valuable data contributors into the Vayu ecosystem.

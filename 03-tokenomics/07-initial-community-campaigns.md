# Initial Community Campaigns

As a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), the community is the absolute cornerstone of Vayu.network's mission. The "Initial Community Campaigns" allocation is specifically designated to bootstrap the network, fuel early growth, and reward our foundational community members.

A dedicated portion of the `$VAYU` supply has been reserved for these initial campaigns. These tokens will be used for a variety of programs designed to build momentum leading up to the mainnet launch, including:

*   **Early Hardware Adoption:** Incentivizing the first wave of users to purchase and deploy Flux devices.
*   **Community Building Rewards:** Rewarding users for participating in community-building activities, such as social media campaigns, content creation, and participating in testnet programs.
*   **Community Sale:** To honor our commitment to a community-first approach, a portion of this allocation may be made available through a community public sale. This initiative would ensure that our most dedicated early supporters can acquire `$VAYU` tokens before the official Token Generation Event (TGE), often at a preferential rate.

The specific details and allocation for these campaigns will be communicated clearly to the community as we approach our launch.

# Staking

Staking is a core component of the Vayu.network's tokenomics, designed to reward long-term commitment, enhance network security, and empower our community. By staking `$VAYU` tokens, users can significantly increase their earning potential and play an active role in the ecosystem's future.

Vayu.network will feature a multi-faceted staking system:

## 1. Data Reward Staking (for Data Contributors)

This is the primary staking mechanism for users contributing data via their Flux devices. By staking `$VAYU` tokens, users can earn a multiplier on the Vayu Points they generate.

*   **How it Works:** Users can lock up a certain amount of `$VAYU` for a chosen duration (e.g., 3, 6, 12 months).
*   **The Benefit:** The more `$VAYU` you stake and the longer you lock it for, the higher the multiplier on your Vayu Point earnings. This directly increases your share of the monthly community rewards pool, creating a powerful incentive for our most committed data providers.

This creates a virtuous cycle: contribute data -> earn `$VAYU` -> stake `$VAYU` -> earn even more `$VAYU` from your data contributions.

## 2. Network Security Staking (Future Implementation)

As the network matures and decentralizes further, a Network Security Staking module will be introduced.

*   **How it Works:** Users will be able to stake their `$VAYU` to help secure the network. This could involve participating in data validation, running light nodes, or other activities that contribute to the integrity and robustness of the Vayu ecosystem.
*   **The Benefit:** Participants in Network Security Staking will earn a base Annual Percentage Yield (APY), paid out in `$VAYU` tokens from the community rewards pool or network revenue. This provides a passive income opportunity for long-term token holders who wish to support the network's core infrastructure.

## 3. Governance Staking (Future Implementation)

To facilitate decentralized governance, `$VAYU` token holders will be able to stake their tokens to participate in the decision-making process.

*   **How it Works:** Users will stake their `$VAYU` in a governance contract to receive voting power (e.g., vVAYU).
*   **The Benefit:** This voting power will allow users to create proposals and vote on key issues affecting the network, such as protocol upgrades, treasury spending, and adjustments to the tokenomics model.

**Important Note:** Staked tokens are locked for the duration of the staking period and cannot be withdrawn until the period ends. This mechanism ensures that those who participate in staking are committed to the long-term health and success of the Vayu.network.

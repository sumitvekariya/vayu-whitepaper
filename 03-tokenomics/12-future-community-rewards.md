# Future Community Rewards

To ensure the long-term sustainability of network incentives beyond the initial token issuance period, a "Future Community Rewards" pool will be established. This pool will serve as the primary source of community rewards in the mature stages of the network.

This self-sustaining treasury will be funded by multiple sources:

1.  **A Percentage of Network Revenue:** A portion of the revenue generated from the sale of Vayu.network's data will be programmatically directed into this pool. This creates a direct link between the commercial success of the network and the rewards distributed to its contributors.
2.  **Unclaimed Tokens:** Any `$VAYU` tokens from airdrops or monthly reward distributions that are not claimed by users within the specified timeframe will be recycled into this pool.
3.  **Future Initiatives:** The pool may also be funded by other future network initiatives as decided by community governance.

This mechanism ensures that there will always be a robust pool of tokens available to incentivize data contribution, keeping the network vibrant and growing for years to come.

Vayu.network has secured funding from strategic venture capital firms and angel investors who believe in our long-term vision of building the world's largest indoor air quality network.

In return for their crucial early-stage support and investment, these backers will receive an allocation of `$VAYU` tokens. All tokens allocated to investors are subject to the vesting schedule outlined in the Token Distribution section to ensure a long-term alignment of interests with the Vayu.network community.

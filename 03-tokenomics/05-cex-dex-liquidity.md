# CEX & DEX Liquidity

To ensure a healthy and stable market for the `$VAYU` token, a dedicated portion of the total supply is allocated for providing liquidity on both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges.

This liquidity is essential for enabling smooth and efficient trading, reducing price volatility, and making it easier for new users and data consumers to enter the Vayu.network ecosystem.

Initially, these tokens will be managed by the foundation responsible for the Vayu.network's launch to establish the initial liquidity pools. Over time, as the network transitions to a decentralized governance model, decisions regarding liquidity provision may be influenced by the votes of `$VAYU` token holders. Tokens held in this allocation are non-voting.

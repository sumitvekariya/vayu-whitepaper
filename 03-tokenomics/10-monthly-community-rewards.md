**Vayu's "Clear Air" Rewards: A Monthly Community Distribution System**

## Win Your Share of Monthly $VAYU Rewards!

Join our monthly community reward distribution, where a large pool of `$VAYU` tokens is up for grabs every single month! By contributing high-quality data to the network, you automatically earn chances to win.

## How It Works

1.  **Collect Points, Earn Chances:** Earn Vayu Points by contributing valid indoor air quality data from your Flux device. Every point earned increases your share of the monthly reward pool.
2.  **Increase Your Share:** The more high-quality data you contribute, the more Vayu Points you accumulate, and the larger your potential `$VAYU` reward will be at the end of the month.
3.  **Claim Your Prizes:** Starting the first week of each month, you'll have **21 days** to claim your `$VAYU` prizes from the previous month's contribution period.

Vayu.network will programmatically distribute a set amount of `$VAYU` tokens from the Community Rewards Reserve each month. This system ensures that all active, contributing users are rewarded for helping to build the network.

## Reward Tiers

While the exact distribution will be calculated based on a user's proportional share of total Vayu Points, the system is designed to reward all levels of contribution, from casual users to our most dedicated data providers.

## Boost Your Rewards with the Contributor Bonus

To reward long-term, consistent participation, a "Contributor Bonus" will be applied to your monthly points total. This bonus will be calculated based on your activity over the previous months, giving a significant advantage to our most loyal community members.

## Stake to Magnify Your Rewards

Users will have the option to stake their `$VAYU` rewards. Staking will not only help secure the network but will also provide a multiplier on your Contributor Bonus, further increasing your earning potential in future reward distributions.

## Rules & Transparency

*   **Reward Calculation:** At the end of each month (e.g., 23:59 UTC on the last day), a snapshot of each user's Vayu Points total will determine their proportional share of that month's reward pool.
*   **Transparency:** The total reward pool for the month and the results of the distribution will be publicly verifiable on-chain and announced through official Vayu.network channels.
*   **Claiming:** Once rewards are calculated, users will have 21 days to claim their `$VAYU` winnings via the mobile app. Any unclaimed `$VAYU` after this period will be returned to the Future Community Rewards pool.
*   **Vesting:** A short linear vesting schedule (e.g., 30 days) will apply from the moment a user claims their monthly rewards to encourage long-term alignment.
*   **Eligibility:** Participation is dependent on local regulations. If your country's laws do not permit participation in token reward programs, you may not be eligible. Please ensure compliance with your local laws.
*   **Fairness:** Users identified as fraudulent by our Anomaly Detection Engine will be banned from the network and will forfeit all rewards.

This system is designed to create a fair, transparent, and exciting reward mechanism that recognizes the valuable contributions of every single member of the Vayu.network community.

# The Vayu Reward Economy

**How Users Earn Rewards with Vayu.network**

The Vayu.network rewards user contributions through a dual system of in-app "Vayu Points" and the network's native cryptocurrency, `$VAYU`. Any activity that adds value to the network, primarily the contribution of valid air quality data from a Flux device, earns users Vayu Points. The more Vayu Points a user accumulates, the larger their share of the `$VAYU` token rewards will be.

## What Are Vayu Points?

Vayu Points are an off-chain, in-app point system designed to measure and reward user contributions to the Vayu.network. Accumulating Vayu Points is the primary way to determine a user's share of the periodic `$VAYU` token distributions. This system allows us to track contributions efficiently and transparently. The Vayu.network team retains the discretion to determine which actions are considered valuable and may adjust the Vayu Point reward structure to reflect the network's evolving dynamics and priorities.

## What Are Vayu Tokens ($VAYU)?

`$VAYU` is the native cryptocurrency of the Vayu.network and the ultimate reward for ecosystem participants. It is the economic engine that powers the entire network. Companies purchase Vayu's aggregated air quality data using `$VAYU` tokens, creating a sustainable value loop. The Vayu Foundation will also issue `$VAYU` from the Community Rewards pool to recognize and incentivize data contributions from users.

`$VAYU` tokens offer real utility within the Vayu ecosystem, with uses including, but not limited to, the following:

*   **Data Purchasing:** Vayu.network's data can only be purchased with `$VAYU` tokens.
*   **Access to Premium Features:** Premium features within the Vayu app and Explorer can be unlocked with `$VAYU`.
*   **Staking:** Token holders can stake their `$VAYU` tokens to earn additional rewards and contribute to network security.
*   **Governance:** In the future, `$VAYU` will be used to vote on key decisions within the network's governance framework.

## The Purpose of $VAYU

The Vayu Foundation oversees the initial distribution of `$VAYU` tokens, allocating the largest share to the community. This is designed to solve the "cold start problem" common to DePINs by providing a strong incentive for early users to purchase Flux devices and begin building the data network. This structure encourages network growth, creates immediate utility for the token, and motivates participants to earn and hold `$VAYU`, driving the expansion of the Vayu.network into new regions and use cases.

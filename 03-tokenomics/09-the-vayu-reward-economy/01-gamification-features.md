**Making Data Contribution an Engaging Experience**

Vayu.network transforms the process of contributing indoor air quality data into an engaging, gamified experience. By integrating these interactive elements, we motivate users to participate actively, turning the simple act of using their Flux device into a fun and rewarding activity.

| **Levels** | Users advance through levels by earning Vayu Points for their data contributions. Each new level can unlock perks like increased point multipliers or exclusive badges. |
| **Badges** | Users earn badges for achieving specific milestones, such as activating their first device, measuring in a new city, maintaining a long contribution streak, or referring friends to the network. |
| **Leaderboards** | Users can see how their contributions stack up against others on global, regional, and friends-only leaderboards, fostering a sense of community and friendly competition. |
| **Missions** | Users can complete daily, weekly, or special event missions (e.g., "Contribute data from an office building") to earn extra Vayu Points and other rewards. |

These features are designed to make being part of the Vayu.network not just economically rewarding, but also enjoyable and socially engaging.

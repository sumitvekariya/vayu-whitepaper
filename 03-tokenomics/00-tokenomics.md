# Tokenomics

The core value of the Vayu.network emerges from the synergistic contributions of our community members; the collective dataset they build is significantly more valuable than the sum of its individual parts. Our reward system is designed to recognize users for their cumulative impact on the network's data coverage and quality. To operationalize this, smart contracts will systematically disburse a predetermined token budget. These tokens, known as `$VAYU` (Vayu Network Tokens), are allocated to users based on their contributions, which are measured by an in-app points system.

## Disclaimer and Limitations

The following sections showcase the mechanisms that will govern the issuance of new tokens and the distribution framework employed to compensate network contributors.

The native cryptographically secure fungible protocol token of the Vayu.network (ticker symbol `$VAYU`) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified within the Vayu.network's protocol/code. It is designed exclusively as an interoperable utility token on the network.

`$VAYU` is a functional multi-utility token that serves as the decentralized medium of exchange between participants on the Vayu.network. The primary purpose of `$VAYU` is to facilitate a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants interacting within the Vayu ecosystem (e.g., for data access) without reliance on intermediaries. It is not intended to be a general medium of exchange for goods or services outside the Vayu.network.

`$VAYU` does not represent any shareholding, ownership, participation, right, title, or interest in Vayu.network, its affiliates, or any other company. Token holders are not entitled to any fees, dividends, revenue, profits, or investment returns, and `$VAYU` is not intended to be classified as a security in any jurisdiction. Ownership of `$VAYU` grants no rights other than the ability to use it to enable interaction within the network. The secondary market pricing of `$VAYU` is independent of the Vayu.network team's efforts, with no functionality or mechanisms to control or influence such pricing.

To clarify, Vayu.network does not engage in the business of buying or selling virtual assets (including `$VAYU`). Any initial token distribution is for the limited purpose of securing project development funds, raising awareness, and fostering community engagement.

Moreover, `$VAYU` provides the economic incentives to reward users who contribute to and participate in the Vayu.network ecosystem. It creates a mutually beneficial system in which all participants are fairly compensated for their efforts. `$VAYU` is a vital and indispensable part of the Vayu.network, as without it, there would be no incentive for users to purchase and deploy Flux devices to provide the data that benefits the entire ecosystem.

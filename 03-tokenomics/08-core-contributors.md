# Core Contributors

The Vayu.network is being built by a dedicated team of engineers, designers, and business developers. To align their long-term incentives with the success of the network, a portion of the total `$VAYU` supply is allocated to these core contributors.

## Core Contributor Responsibilities:

*   Designing, manufacturing, and improving the Flux hardware.
*   Developing and maintaining the Vayu mobile applications for iOS and Android.
*   Building and managing the secure and scalable backend infrastructure, data processing pipelines, and reward distribution mechanisms.
*   Developing and operating the Vayu Explorer and B2B data API.
*   Forging partnerships and driving the commercial strategy to monetize the network's data.
*   Fostering and managing the Vayu community across all platforms (Discord, social media, etc.) and providing user support.

A portion of this allocation is also reserved for strategic advisors who provide invaluable expertise in areas such as hardware manufacturing, blockchain technology, and business development.

All tokens allocated to core contributors and advisors are subject to a long-term vesting schedule, as outlined in the Token Distribution section. This ensures that the team is committed to the project's success for years to come and is fully aligned with the interests of the community.

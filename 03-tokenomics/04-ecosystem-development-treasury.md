# Ecosystem Development & Treasury

A substantial portion of the total token supply is allocated to the Ecosystem Development & Treasury fund. This treasury is critical for ensuring the long-term sustainability, growth, and technological advancement of the Vayu.network.

These funds will be used to support a wide range of initiatives, including:

*   **Project Development:** Continued research and development of the Flux hardware, the Vayu mobile app, the backend infrastructure, and the Vayu Explorer.
*   **Ecosystem Grants:** Providing grants to independent developers, researchers, and startups who build new tools, applications, or integrations on top of the Vayu.network's data.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** Funding partnerships with other projects, institutions, or companies that can accelerate the growth and adoption of Vayu.network.
*   **Community Incentives & Marketing:** Supporting marketing campaigns, community events, and other incentive programs designed to grow our user base and increase network participation.

Tokens held in the treasury are non-voting and are subject to the vesting schedule outlined in the Token Distribution section to ensure a long-term alignment with the project's success.

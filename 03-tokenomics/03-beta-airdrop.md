# Early Adopter Airdrop

To kickstart the network and reward our earliest and most active supporters, a significant portion of the token supply is reserved for an early adopter airdrop. This program is designed to recognize the first users who purchase a Flux device, connect it to the network, and begin contributing valuable indoor air quality data.

## Airdrop Mechanics

At the Token Generation Event (TGE), a percentage of the airdrop allocation will be immediately available to eligible users. The remainder will be vested linearly over a set period (e.g., six months) from the moment the user claims their airdrop. A claiming window (e.g., 21 days) will be established post-TGE. Any unclaimed tokens after this window will be returned to the Community Rewards pool for future ecosystem incentives.

Each user's share of the airdrop will be determined by their contribution to the network, calculated based on the quantity and quality of data their Flux device has provided. This will be tracked via an in-app points system.

To ensure rewards are distributed fairly and incentivize high-quality contributions, the airdrop will use a tiered league system. Users will be ranked based on their total points, and the reward multipliers will be applied as follows:

| League | % of Users | Reward Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diamond | Top 10% | 2.5x |
| Platinum | 10% | 2.0x |
| Gold | 10% | 1.5x |
| Silver | 10% | 1.25x |
| Bronze | 10% | 1.0x (Baseline) |
| Iron | 10% | 0.75x |
| Copper | 10% | 0.5x |
| Tin | 10% | 0.25x |
| Lead | 10% | 0.1x |
| Stone | Bottom 10% | 0.05x |

## Special Bonuses

*   **Pioneer Bonus:** To recognize the very first wave of supporters, a special, fixed bonus of `$VAYU` tokens will be distributed equally among the first users to activate a device on the network (e.g., the first 10,000 users).
*   **Lucky Contributor Bonus:** To add an element of chance and fun, a "Lucky Contributor" bonus pool will be distributed randomly among a set number of users (e.g., 1,000) who have met a minimum data contribution threshold.

This multi-faceted airdrop strategy ensures that our most dedicated early members are generously rewarded, kickstarting a vibrant and engaged community from day one.
